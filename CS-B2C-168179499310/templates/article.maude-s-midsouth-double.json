Knowing how to move in a group, how to navigate mass starts, how much I needed to eat and drink on the bike all served me on Saturday.

Those little pieces of knowledge, action, choices all add up in something like this. <\/p><p>I'm really proud of this achievement because beyond the fact that it's difficult and hard, it validates all the years and years of effort, experience, and execution that I've dedicated to sport.
