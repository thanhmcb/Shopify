It consists of a new dust cover design that sits safely anchored in a groove in the pulley wheel, thereby completely enclosing the bearing. This is paired with a bladed groove structure that surrounds the dust cover, which dynamically extracts debris from the pulley wheel when it's rotating.ADR has been developed in a constant pendulum between our R&D department, the CeramicSpeed test lab, and field testing conducted by a select group of our professional off-road teams. ADR was tested to its limits during this year's Cape Epic, where our XCM team Buff\/Megamo was riding prototype versions of a solid pulley wheel featuring ADR. During what proved to be the worst conditions experienced at Cape in recent times, the ADR feature stood its ground and kept all mud, water, and debris from entering the bearing. <\/p>",

During the 2022 CycloCross season, our sponsored team Tormans used the solid disc design extensively and provided valuable feedback on its ability to provide mud clearance in the worst of conditions.<\/p>",
