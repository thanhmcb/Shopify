The best thing you can do generally is to put the turntable on a shelf that is mounted on the wall.<\/p><p>It’s also very important that the turntable is level.

This is also sometimes referred to as downforce or VTF (Vertical Tracking Force). First of all, look in the data sheet for the cartridge, or on the manufacturer's website, and see what amount of pressure the manufacturer recommends. Usually, it’s between 1.5 – 3 grams.<\/p><p>To adjust the needle pressure, use the counterweight – the small, round weight located at the back of the tone arm. For our turntables here are the correct settings (with the standard pickup):<\/p><p>TT: 3 grams<br\/>TT-3: 1.75 grams<\/p><p>Start by finding the point where the tone arm with the cartridge mounted is “floating” in the air because there is no down force applied. This is found by adjusting the counterweight forward or backward on the arm until you can let go of the arm and it does not move up or down. NOTE! Remember to remove the protective cap on the cartridge before adjustment.<\/p><p>When the weight is adjusted so the arm is \"floating\", you hold on to the weight itself and turn the small scale so that the 0 is at 12 o’clock – signifying that there is no weight added to the arm. This small scale can be rotated independently of the large weight. Now, turn both the counterweight and the scale towards the arm until the correct weight is applied to the cartridge.<\/p>",
