            "content": "<p>One often overlooked aspect of high-quality active speakers is that 1+1 doesn’t equal 2—it equals 4. This means that a conventional passive speaker would need a 200 watt amplifier in order to achieve the same performance as an active speaker with only a 2 X 50 watt amplifier! This is one of the reasons why active speakers sound so powerful compared to passive speakers.<br\/><br\/>The DSP (Digital Signal Processing) is an important part of this puzzle. DSP is used to design the crossover and response of the speaker with a precision only possible in active speakers.<br\/><br\/>DSP in combination with active speakers gives more freedom to design optimized drivers without making any compromises. Typically, the woofers in a passive speaker have a mechanical break to avoid damage at high sound levels. Using DSP supervision, the woofer can be designed with higher linearity since the breaking is handled by the DSP. In addition to this, with DSP we can correct speaker response without deterioration - this is simply not possible in a passive speaker.<br\/>The woofers in FORTE A55 are a prime example of the benefits of transducer design, using DSP. We designed a new motor system with a focus on very low distortion - all without looking at parameters since these can be controlled using DSP. These woofers won’t work in a passive speaker design, but in an active speaker with DSP they shine with class-leading low distortion and extended frequency response.<\/p>",

Our goal when creating these active speakers was to provide superior quality and features while keeping them budget friendly. They are perfect for new hi-fi enthusiasts who want to experience high-quality sound without compromising ease of use. To provide all this value in the speakers, we decided to use high-quality PVC for cabinet construction, and the amplifiers and drivers are slightly less powerful and of slightly lower quality compared to FORTE. However, the sound quality remains top-notch. We've tuned the sound to have an extra bass punch for a fun and lively sound profile that will blow away any soundbar.<br\/><br\/>With their sleek Danish design, FENRIS speakers are as visually impressive as they sound. FENRIS is the ideal choice for new hi-fi enthusiasts, offering kick-ass sound experiences that provide great value for money.<br\/><\/p><ul><li>Emphasizes a fun, hi-fi sound profile with more pronounced bass.<\/li><li>Constructed from high-quality PVC<\/li><li>Bluetooth 5.0<\/li><li>HDMI ARC for TV audio<\/li><li>Supports High-Res Audio at up to 24-bit\/48 kHz<\/li><li>Priced from 329 € per pair.<\/li><\/ul>",
