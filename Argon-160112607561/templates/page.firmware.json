It is <strong>NOT <\/strong>intended for use with the device in an upright position. Additionally, this update is <strong>NOT <\/strong>compatible with the earlier version FORTE A4 (MK1).<\/p><p>The smallest FORTE A4 MK2 can be placed inside a piece of furniture for a discreet setup. It could be hi-fi furniture such as UNNU\/CLIC 130, 131, etc. We have developed a special sound profile and guide for this purpose.<\/p><h4><strong>How should I place the speakers in the furniture? <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0264\/7428\/3096\/files\/fortea4_furniture.jpg?v=1706516071\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0264\/7428\/3096\/files\/fortea4_furniture.jpg?v=1706516071\"><strong>(see picture)<\/strong><\/a><\/h4><ul><li>When it comes to placing the speakers in the furniture, there are various opinions on the optimal configuration. Ultimately, you should position them in a way that you believe enhances their sound quality. Our engineer, Michael, have 4 reasons why he recommends having woofers on the outside.<\/li><li>We design Argon active speakers to radiate less downwards (when placed upside) to avoid reflections from the floor. This is a luxury we have, because of DSP and really helps when placing speakers in a room with hard floors. Having woofers on the outside in a furniture means the speaker has the right angle to the listener.<\/li><li>Stereo information and the width of the sound image is opposite what many believes in the midrange and not the treble. So having midranges on the outside create the biggest sound image.<\/li><li>When sound waves are much longer that the radiator, the sound radiates 360 degrees. For a normal sized speaker this happens below 500 Hz and means half the sound is send back into the cavity of the furniture and creating resonances. Having woofers on the outside means much less sound is radiated into the furniture and so less coloration.<\/li><li>Having woofers close (but not too close) to each other creates beaming in the midrange and strong comb filter effects when not listening exactly in centre of the speakers. Having the woofers on the outside creates a better balance between direct and in-direct sound and so makes a more natural timbre.<\/li><\/ul><h3>To update the speakers, please do the following:<\/h3><ol><li>Put the \"A4_MK2.hex\" file on an empty USB drive (MAX 32 GB - formatted as FAT32)*. Remember to \"eject\" it properly before removing it from the computer<\/li><li>Power off the speaker completely by removing the power cable (wait until there is no light in the LED on the front)<\/li><li>Plug it into the USB port on the back of the speaker<\/li><li>Power on the speaker. The LED on the front will flash red\/blue for a few seconds, telling you that the update is in progress. When it's done, the LED will go back to constant red.<\/li><li>Remove the USB drive. The speakers are now updated!<\/li><\/ol>",
