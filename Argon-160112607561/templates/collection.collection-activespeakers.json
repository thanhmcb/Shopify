            "content": "<p>One often overlooked aspect of high-quality active speakers is that 1+1 doesn’t equal 2—it equals 4. This means that a conventional passive speaker would need a 200 watt amplifier in order to achieve the same performance as an active speaker with only a 2 X 50 watt amplifier! This is one of the reasons why active speakers sound so powerful compared to passive speakers.<\/p><p>The DSP (Digital Signal Processing) is an important part of this puzzle. DSP is used to design the crossover and response of the speaker with a precision only possible in active speakers.<\/p><p>DSP in combination with active speakers gives more freedom to design optimized drivers without making any compromises. Typically, the woofers in a passive speaker have a mechanical break to avoid damage at high sound levels. Using DSP supervision, the woofer can be designed with higher linearity since the breaking is handled by the DSP. In addition to this, with DSP we can correct speaker response without deterioration - this is simply not possible in a passive speaker.<br\/>The woofers in FORTE A55 are a prime example of the benefits of transducer design, using DSP. We designed a new motor system with a focus on very low distortion - all without looking at parameters since these can be controlled using DSP. These woofers won’t work in a passive speaker design, but in an active speaker with DSP they shine with class-leading low distortion and extended frequency response.<\/p>"

While your soundbar might be great, and your streaming speaker in the kitchen is very convenient, they can only produce 'mono' sound, which can often sound flat.

This is not just a marketing claim, as studies have shown that humans are naturally designed to perceive sound in stereo.<br\/><br\/>Just imagine how you would feel if a movie theater only had a soundbar or if a concert had speakers on just one side. What if you could only wear a headphone on one ear while gaming? You wouldn't be happy, so why settle for less at home when you can have the same great stereo sound experience?<\/p>",
