This combination of Zirconium rings and silicon nitride balls in ceramic bearings results in a bearing solution with a low friction coefficient, reduced mass, and remarkable resistance to water, chemicals, and other aggressive media. Moreover, the use of ceramic balls, such as Silicon Nitride, provides distinct advantages over traditional steel balls. Ceramic balls offer enhanced durability, corrosion resistance, and a lighter weight, contributing to overall improved performance and service life of the bearing system.<\/p>",
