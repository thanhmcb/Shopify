The ceramic balls provide protection, reducing wear and minimizing the risk of electrical corrosion. This combination of insulation and durability translates to an extended service life for the bearings, contributing to the economic viability of electric motor applications.<\/p><p>In environments with high-frequency operations, such as those found in electric motors, insulated bearings play a crucial role in mitigating the risks associated with electrical issues. The steel rings used for our Xtreme and Insulate series are made from 100Cr6 (Nr. 1.3505), which is the globally accepted standard bearing steel. 100Cr6, when hardened properly, presents an optimum compromise between surface hardness and core toughness, and its machinability allows for raceways with super smooth surfaces, allowing quiet and long-lasting bearings. The inner ring and outer ring, coupled with the ceramic rolling elements, prevent the flow of electric current through the shaft and rotor, safeguarding against potential electrical discharge and subsequent damage.<\/p>",

Unlike traditional steel balls, ceramic balls are non-electrically conductive, also called insulated bearings, creating an effective barrier against the passage of electrical currents within the bearing. This inherent property acts as a safeguard, isolating the bearing from potential electrical issues that could lead to wear, damage, or other operational complications.<\/p><p>As a result of this electrical insulation, hybrid bearings with ceramic balls experience reduced wear and tear, mitigating the need for frequent maintenance and repairs. The non-conductive nature of the ceramic material ensures a more stable and durable bearing performance over time, making it well-suited for applications where electrical isolation is a critical consideration.<\/p><p>The integration of ceramic balls in hybrid bearings not only enhances mechanical properties but also provides a reliable solution to minimize maintenance and repair interventions, thanks to the inherent electrical insulation properties of ceramic materials.<\/p><p>Furthermore, the incorporation of ceramic balls in these bearings enhances their resistance to electrical corrosion, making them a reliable choice for applications where protection against wear and tear is essential. This not only ensures the sustained functionality of the bearings but also contributes to the overall efficiency of the electric motor.<\/p><p>In conclusion, insulated hybrid bearings with ceramic balls emerge as a state-of-the-art solution, combining electrically insulated features and ceramic balls to provide superior protection against shaft voltage and electrical corrosion. These bearings offer an economical and reliable alternative, delivering higher operational reliability and an extended service life for electric motors operating in diverse and demanding conditions.<\/p>",
