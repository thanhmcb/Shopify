So, when we’re building wheel bearings, we naturally look to push the boundaries of just how fast we can make the wheels without jeopardizing important safety aspects. This is done by experimenting with multiple bearings loaded with differing sizes of CeramicSpeed Balls.<\/p><p>In this process our R&D team is on the hunt for the lowest amount of friction achievable for the specific wheels under test before axial play (lateral movement) occurs. It’s a delicate balancing act where the optimal radial clearance, which in turn delivers the optimal spinning qualities, is achieved by fitting the bearings with the size of CeramicSpeed Balls just below the ones where the wheels show lateral movement. Figuratively, it’s like we’re hitting a sharp corner and leaning as far as humanly possible into it without ending our ride on the tarmac.<\/p><p>After meticulous testing on the road our R&D team will have worked out their precise recommendations for the wheelset’s unique radial clearance. In other words, the process starts with objective methods and measurements and ends up with a subjective recommendation based upon years and years of experience and findings. From here, their notes are turned into a building plan in our product department. Bearing races, CeramicSpeed Balls, seals and grease, are all carefully selected and controlled, before being assembled into fully customized bearings.<\/p><p>Customers who own wheels which we haven’t previously built bearings for will also benefit from this unique process. It’s a trickle-down effect, where our many years of collaborating with the most renowned wheel brands in the business has made it possible for us to develop our own blueprint of how to achieve the appropriate radial clearance in most instances. In this way our team of specialists will be able to build a wheel kit for your specific setting, using our <a href=\"\/en\/cycling\/shop\/single-bearings\">CeramicSpeed Single Bearings<\/a> and <a href=\"\/en\/cycling\/shop\/ceramicspeed-balls\">Balls<\/a>, and make sure you get the same optimized solution as our partners.<\/p>",
