Having a built-in RIAA means you can avoid using an external box to connect your system and turntable.

Then, connect the turntable to your Argon Audio active speaker with just one cable – it's that simple! Ensure that you set the needle pressure correctly to avoid damaging your records. Too much pressure can cause the needle to wear down quickly, while too little pressure can result in distortion and skipping.<\/p><p>You can either read our in-depth guide on how to set up your turntable, or watch our unboxing and setup videos for a step-by-step visual guide<\/p>"
